Simple Messaging Bus for Node.js entities over [NatsIO](https://nats.io)

The library allows one to transparently publish and scale plain vanilla JS objects to a running [nats.io](https://nats.io) instance as services objects.

The concept is simple:
- entities with services to be published are defined within your application. Each entity must possess a unique name.
- all functions defined be the entities are can be called through the message bus
- any amount of [darcon](https://github.com/imrefazekas/darcon) instance can be created around a given entity allowing one to scale a service endlessly over [nats.io](https://nats.io).

!Note: the presente of the messge bus induces the requirement of _'jsonifiable'_ objects to be passed as paramters!

A single [darcon](https://github.com/imrefazekas/darcon) instance can manage multiple entities. To scale a service up, a single entity can be published to multiple [darcon](https://github.com/imrefazekas/darcon) instances.

The [darcon](https://github.com/imrefazekas/darcon) instances know about each other and share the "map of entities" and manage message transmission to load balance.


## Installation

```javascript
npm install daron
```

## Usage

```javascript
const Darconer = require('darcon')
// ...
await Darconer.init( {
	nats: {
		servers: 'nats://localhost:4222'
	},

	log: {
		level: 'info'
	}
} )
// ...
await Darconer.publish(
	{
		name: 'Marie',
		async greetings () {
			return 'Hello'
		}
	}
)
```

That is all!
